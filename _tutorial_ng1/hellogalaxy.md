In the ["Hello Solar System!"](hellosolarsystem) app, we created a list/detail interface.
We showed a list of `people` and allowed the user to drill down to view a single `person`'s details.
We implemented both the `people` and `person` states as siblings (peers to each other).
When `people` was active, `person` could not be active, and vice versa.

In this section, we will create a parent-child state relationship by nesting the `person` state _inside_ the `people` state.
We will also nest their views, showing `person` details inside the `people` component.

## Live demo

As usual, let's first look at a live demo of the finished "Hello Galaxy" app.

Click the "People" tab, then click on a person.

When you switch from one state to the another, it is called a Transition. 
On the bottom of the plunker, the [UI-Router Transition Visualizer](https://github.com/ui-router/visualizer)
shows each transition visually, and provides transition details when hovered and/or clicked.

# Nesting States

UI-Router states form a tree, starting from a single root state.
The root state is implicit and has no name.
The top-level application states (such as `about` and `people` are children of the implicit root state.

The "Hello Solar System" app had four top-level states, while the 
"Hello Galaxy" app has three top-level states and one nested state.

The `person` state is now a child of the `people` state.

The new `person` state definition:

```js
var personState = { 
  name: 'people.person', 
  url: '/{personId}', 
  component: 'person',
  resolve: {
    person: function(people, $stateParams) {
      return people.find(function(person) { 
        return person.id === $stateParams.personId;
      });
    }
  }
}
```



![Changes to Person state definition](/assets/tutorial/ss-to-galaxy-diff.png)
We made some changes to the `person` state properties to make it a nested state... let's go over each change.



## State name

We changed the `name:` from `person` to `people.person`.

When naming a state, prepending another state's name (and a dot) creates a parent/child relationship.
In this case, the `people.person` state is a child of the `people` state.

Another way to create a parent/child relationship is with the `parent:` property of a state definition.
{: .notice--info}

## URL

We changed the `url:` from `/people/{personId}` to the url fragment `/{personId}`.

The child state's `url:` property is a url fragment (a partial url).
The full url for a child state is built by appending the child state's url fragment to the parent state's url.

The url for the parent state (`people`) is still `/people`.
Appending `/{personId}` to `/people` results in `/people/{personId}`, which is the same as our original url.

The router will map a browser url of `/people` to the `people` state.  
It will map a browser url of `/people/123` to the `person` state, with a `peopleId` parameter value of "123".

## Resolve

We changed the `resolve:` to use the data from the parent resolve, instead of fetching it from the server.

As before, when you click the "People" tab the router fetches the `people` resolve from the server API, 
then activates the `people` state and renders the view.

With our new nested state setup, the `person` resolve is a bit different.
When we click a specific person, the router still invokes the `person` resolve before activating the `person` state.
However, this resolve is a bit different.
Instead of fetching the person from the server, the `person` resolve injects the parent state's `people` resolve.
Since the list of people is already loaded in the parent resolve, no additional fetching occurs.

A resolve function may inject the results of other resolves from ancestor states, or from other resolves on the same state.
{: .notice--info}


## Views

The view for `person` hasn't changed.
It is still a component named `person`, which has an input binding named `person`.
The resolve data named `person` is still provided to the input binding.

However, the parent state's `people` component has changed a bit.

{% raw %}
```html
<!-- outer container -->
<div class="flex-h">  

  <!-- inner container for people -->
  <div class="people">
  
    <h3>Some people:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li ng-repeat="person in $ctrl.people">
        <a ui-sref-active="active" 
           ui-sref="people.person({ personId: person.id })">
          {{person.name}}
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
  </div>
  
  <!-- viewport for child view -->
  <ui-view></ui-view>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}

We've added some container `div`s for layout and embedded a nested `<ui-view></ui-view>` viewport.
When a child of `people` is activated, its view is put into the viewport.
We also added some styling to create a side by side layout, so the nested viewport appears on the right.

  <source src="/assets/tutorial/nested view.mov.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="/assets/tutorial/nested view.mov.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

Note the nested `<ui-view>` when "People" is activated.
That `<ui-view>` is filled with the `person` view when the `person` state is active.

## Links

We also changed the `ui-sref` links in the `people` state which drill down to a specific person.

Previously, these links were `<a ui-sref="person({ personId: person.id })">`.
Since the `person` state is now named `people.person`, we changed the links to `<a ui-sref="people.person({ personId: person.id })">`.

We could also have used relative addressing: `<a ui-sref=".person({ personId: person.id })">`.
The target state for the `ui-sref` is to its view's state.
Since the `ui-sref` was created in the `people` state's view and relatively targets `.person`, the final target state is `people.person`.
