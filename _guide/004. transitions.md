This guide provides a conceptual overview to state transitions in UI-Router.

# Transition overview

UI-Router applications behave like a state machine.
Each part of the application (i.e., each route or page) is represented by an application state.
Only one state can be active at a time.
The user changes the active state by following links, clicking on buttons, using the back button, etc.

<figure class="half-center">
    <img src="/assets/guide-transitions/hello-about.gif">
    <figcaption>Switching between "Hello" and "About" states by clicking links.  The state visualizer (right) shows the active state.</figcaption>
</figure>

The process of changing application states is called a **Transition**.
The state machine _transitions_ from one state to another.

### From state/to state

Each Transition has a _from state_ (the state that was previously active) and a _to state_ (the state being activated).

<figure class="half-center">
    <img src="/assets/guide-transitions/from-to.png">
    <figcaption>Clicking the 'About' link starts a transition _from_ the 'hello' state _to_ the 'about' state.</figcaption>
</figure>

UI-Router provides a `Transition` object which represents a transition.
Access the to and from states using `Transition.to()` and `Transition.from()`.
{: .notice--info}

### Exiting and entering

During the transition from 'Hello' to 'About', the 'Hello' state is _exited_, and the 'About' state is _entered_.

<figure class="half-center">
    <img src="/assets/guide-transitions/exit-enter.png">
    <figcaption>The transition exits 'Hello' and enters 'About'.</figcaption>
</figure>

Access the entering and exiting states using `Transition.entering()` and `Transition.exiting()`.
{: .notice--info}

Exiting or entering a state is a lifecycle event and will be covered later.

### Param value changes

A transition also occurs when a parameter value changes, _even if the to and from states are the same_.
Each parameter is defined on a specific state.
When a state's parameter value changes, the state is exited and then re-entered.

<figure class="half-center">
    <img src="/assets/guide-transitions/john-jane.png">
    <figcaption>When the 'jane' link is clicked, the Transition exits the 'person' state
                then re-enters the 'person' state with the `name` parameter value equal to `jane`.</figcaption>
</figure>

Access the new and previous parameter values using `Transition.params('to')` and `Transition.params('from')`.
{: .notice--info}

### Nested states

Applications aren't limited to a flat list of states. 
Instead, they often define child states creating a hierarchy of nested states.

When a parent state is active and the user navigates to a child state, a Transition from the parent state to the child starts.
Because the parent state was already entered, it is not entered a second time.
Instead, the parent state is _retained_ (it was previously entered and is still entered).
The child state then becomes the active state.

<figure class="half-center">
    <img src="/assets/guide-transitions/parent-to-child.png">
    <figcaption>When the link is clicked, a Transition from 'people' to the nested 'person' state starts.
                The transition enters the 'person' state.
                The 'people' state is retained.
                </figcaption>
</figure>

If the child state is active, and the user navigates to the parent state, a Transition occurs from the child to the parent state.
The child state is exited and the parent state becomes the active state.
Because the parent state was already entered, it is _retained_ (not entered a second time).

<figure class="half-center">
    <img src="/assets/guide-transitions/parent-to-child-to-parent.gif">
    <figcaption>The active state moves between 'people' and 'person'.
     The parent state ('people') is retained, while the child state ('person') is entered and exited.</figcaption>
</figure>

Access the retained states using `Transition.retained()`.
{: .notice--info}

A single Transition may enter (or exit) multiple nested states.
If the "to state" of the Transition is a nested state whose parent is not already active, then:

- The parent is entered
- The child (the to state) is entered
- The child (the to state) becomes the active state

In the same way, when a transition _from_ the nested child state to a sibling of the parent state occurs:

- The child is exited
- The parent is exited
- The sibling of the parent (the to state) is entered
- The sibling of the parent becomes the active state

    <figcaption>Multiple states being entered or exited during each Transition</figcaption>
</figure>

### Transition Triggers

A transition occurs any time the application state changes, or when any parameter values change.
This could be triggered in a variety of ways:

- A `UISref` link was clicked
- `StateService.go()` was called programmatically
- The URL changed
  - The application has just started, and the initial URL is being processed
  - The back or forward button was clicked
  - The user manually changed the URL in the browser location bar
  - (In some cases) an anchor tag with an `href` was clicked


# Transition Lifecycle

A transition can perform asynchronous asynchronous operations such as fetching data or accessing back-end APIs.
Because of this, a transition should be considered a long running operation.

### Lifecycle events

A transition has lifecycle events, from creation to completion.
Those events are:

- **Create**: The transition is being created
- **Before**: The transition is about to start
- **Start**: The transition has started
- **Exit**: (state events) Any exiting states are exited
- **Retain**: (state events) Any retained states are retained
- **Enter**: (state events) Any entering states are entered
- **Finish**: The transition is about to finish
- **Success**/**Error**: The transition is finished and is either successful or errored.

### Atomicity

Transitions between states should be considered atomic.
A transition will either fully succeed, or fail entirely.

Although transitions may take a long time to process,
the current state remains unchanged _until after the transition succeeds_.

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/guide-transitions/transition-success.png">
    <figcaption>Transition from state 'A' to 'B'</figcaption>
</figure>

If a transition from state 'A' to state 'B' errors, the current state remains unchanged as state 'A'.

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/guide-transitions/transition-error.png">
    <figcaption>Failed Transition from state 'A' to 'B'</figcaption>
</figure>

Only one transition can run at a time.
If a previous transition is still running _when a new transition_ starts, the router aborts the previous transition.
The new transition *supersedes* the previous transition.
The previous transition errors with a `Transition Superseded` error.

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/guide-transitions/transition-superseded.png">
    <figcaption>Transition #2 supersedes Transition #1</figcaption>
</figure>

If a transition to the *current state and parameters* is attempted, the router ignores the transition attempt.
This might happen, e.g., when the user clicks a link to the currently activated state.

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/guide-transitions/transition-ignored1.png">
    <figcaption>Transition to current state ignored</figcaption>
</figure>

If a transition is running and another transition to the same target state and parameters is attempted, the router ignores the second attempt.
This might happen, e.g., when the user clicks a link twice, but the first transition has not yet completed.

    <figcaption>Duplicate transition ignored</figcaption>

# Transition Hooks

Transition hooks allow you to tap into each of the lifecycle events using callbacks.
